<p>FINIR CATCH COVER CROPS</p>
<p>This is the pre-processing of the crops fertilization data in Bretagne region for the years 2015-2020. It uses the RPG data coupled with typical fertilization values. Vineyards and orchards are poorly reported in the RPG database, so we rather use the TOPO database for these 2 crops.</p>

<p>EXPLIQUER CE QUE CA FAIT</p>
<p>First we load the data where for each agricultural plots, the cultivated crop and the area are reported (PARCELLES_GRAPHIQUES files).</p>
<p>We also load the data with the agricultural crop clusters (ILOTS_ANONYMES files). These agricultural crop clusters gather several contiguous agricultural plots from 1 same farmer. This is used to check that the reported areas are coherent between the 2 files.</p>
<p>We assign each agricultural plot to an agricultural crop clusters.</p>
<p>PREPROCESSING, UNCOMMENT TO REPRODUCE</p>
<p>We link each agricultural plot to a region (old French regions). This will be used to assign to each plot a regional fertilization rate.</p>
